- **[5★] 2025-10-23T21:29:03Z** — I looked for a place to rival Cloud 10 on the east shore. I thought that Cloud 10 was the greatest car wash in the area, especially in light of all the extra amenities. I thought that I'd have to travel to the west shore to have my car cleaned because I didn't believe we had anything as good here on the east shore. And then I tried Shiny Shell. It's Cloud 10 on steroids. What a great experience it…
