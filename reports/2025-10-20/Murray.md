- **[4★] 2025-10-15T16:41:38Z** — We have a membership here and it's been one of the better ones. Only complaint is the water blaster in the member lounge doesn't always work but hey its for the kids. Other than that great car wash
- **[5★] 2025-10-14T17:56:53Z** — I love Shiny Shell. I signed up right when they opened and was impressed from the beginning. The added extras of microfiber drying/cleaning cloths, glass and all-purpose cleaner, compressed air, mat cleaner, soda fountain!! are the best. It can get busy sometimes but usually the line is only 1-4 cars.

- **[5★] 2025-10-13T20:06:45Z** — Love this car wash, I think I got a membership the week it opened. They’ve kept a high bar ever since. Vacuums are top notch! Staff is super nice. We were in between buying new cars and Stephanie was super kind and sent us through for a free wash while I was borrowing my sisters car. Thanks!!
