They have compressed air at every cleaning stations with micro fiber towels, all purpose cleaner, & glass cleaner. I recommend this over the rest.
- **[4★] 2025-10-16T21:36:06Z** — by far the best car wash facility in Utah County. The attendants aren't pushy salesman, which I appreciate. There have been a few times with now rags in any of the baskets though.
