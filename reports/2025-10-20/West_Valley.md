The white truck  is gone, the vacuum cleaners are unclogged, the bathroom is open (finally), everything is clean, and the lady is friendly. Congratulations, West Valley has become a place to wash my car again. I didn’t see the bad manager. Thanks for all your help.

The transmission went out in my car and I had a rental and the general manager Matt went above and beyond to help me get my rental car set up so I can get my car washed while driving Lyft. I love this car wash. Good
