- **[1★] 2025-10-18T13:41:31Z** — Wasted my gas to get an over the top rinse off that the rain could've gotten better. I would've liked it if my car was fully dirty than partially clean. Still gotta wash my car, doing it by hand since you can't trust anywhere. If there was a rating below 1 star I'd rate it that.
